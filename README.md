"# Offensive-Defensive-and-Networking-Project"  
- Summary - I was able to implement alerts and thresholds that I thought would be effective against an attack. I was able to access a vulnerable VM and make sure the Kibana rules that I made work as I thought they did. I then monitored that live network using Wireshark and was able to analyze malicious traffic on the wire.  
- Role - Security Engineer supporting a SOC infrastructure  
- Tools - Wireshark, Kibana, nmap, John the Ripper
